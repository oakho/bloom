#Bloom v0.1.1

Simple & lightweight PHP Framework heavily inspired from great framework like Cake, Laravel or Fuel.

My purpose behind the project was to understand all of the cogwheel acting together in a MVC framework and experiment the PHP language, especially new PHP 5.4 features.

This is still a work in progress.

Cheers !
